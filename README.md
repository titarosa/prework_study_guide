 # Prework Study Guide Talita Rosa Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for the coding boot camp I'm taking. 

## Why?
I'm passionate about technology and excited to create interactive web applications, so I built this project to apply my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills practically, which helps me practice and improve my web development skills while providing a functional and attractive web experience for users, and through this process, I learned how to structure, style, and add interactivity to web pages, along with debugging and optimizing code for better performance.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a handy resource that organizes notes on <strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git </strong> . Each section offers concise content to help you grasp web development basics. By opening the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript code running, which lists the topics covered and randomly selects one for you to study first, making learning more interactive.
